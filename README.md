# Leetcode Algorithms' Solutions
 ### 1.Palindrome Number
 Palindrome numbers are numbers that give the same result when read from right to left and left to right. For example, 121 and 285582 are palindrome numbers.

 ### 2.Valid Palindrome
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 ### 3. Binary Search
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1. The algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 ### 4. Build Array from Permutation
Given a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array ans of the same length where ans[i] = nums[nums[i]] for each 0 <= i < nums.length and return it.
A zero-based permutation nums is an array of distinct integers from 0 to nums.length - 1 (inclusive).

### 5. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
